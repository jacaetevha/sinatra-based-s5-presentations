= SinBaSP (Sinatra Based S5 Presentations)

This is a minimal HTML based presentation tool running on Sinatra, using the S5 library from Eric Meyer (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/).

== Sample App

Look at the <tt>lib/slides.rb</tt> for an example of how to use this.

Run with (viewable at http://localhost:4567):
  ruby slideshow.rb

To run with ERb you need to set an environment variable called <tt>sinbasp_engine</tt> and set it to <tt>erb</tt>.

In BASH, you can run this command to start up the script and set it to run with ERb:
  sinbasp_engine=erb ruby slideshow.rb

== Dependencies
- Sinatra >= 0.9.0

== To Do
- Make styles more easily configurable so that the we don't have to edit the templates as much
- Should write some more documentation
